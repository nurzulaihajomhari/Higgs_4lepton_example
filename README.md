A Higgs example for CMS Open Data.

The purpose of the example is to demonstrate a possibility of doing physics analysis with CMS Open Data.

Only codes with my main contribution are included here.

Details on the Higgs to 4 lepton example can be found in the cms-opendata-analyses github [1] and the CERN Open Data portal [2].
